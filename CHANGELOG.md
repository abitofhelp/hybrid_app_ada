## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-28

_First stable release - Professional Ada 2022 application starter template demonstrating hybrid DDD/Clean/Hexagonal architecture with functional programming principles._

### Added

#### Architecture
- **5-Layer Hexagonal Architecture**: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation, Bootstrap
- **Static Dispatch via Generics**: Zero-overhead dependency injection using Ada generics
- **Railway-Oriented Programming**: Result monads for functional error handling
- **Application.Error Re-export Pattern**: Presentation isolation from Domain
- **Single-Project Structure**: Simplified from aggregate project
- **Comprehensive UML Diagrams**: 5 PlantUML diagrams with SVG generation
- **Architecture Validation**: arch_guard.py enforces layer boundaries

#### Cross-Cutting
- **Version Package** (`src/version/`): Outside hexagonal layers with own GPR
  - `Hybrid_App_Ada.Version` with semantic version constants
  - Auto-generated by release scripts from alire.toml
  - Own `version.gpr` library project
- **Version Display in CLI Help**: Show version when invalid arguments provided

#### Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 90 tests achieving 90%+ code coverage:
  - 74 unit tests (Domain + Application layers, 100% coverage)
  - 8 integration tests (cross-layer flows with real components)
  - 8 E2E tests (black-box CLI binary testing)
- **Professional test framework** (test/common/test_framework):
  - Color-coded test output (bright green success, bright red failure)
  - `Print_Category_Summary` function for consistent, professional test reporting
  - Exit code integration for CI/CD pipelines
  - Reusable test helpers eliminating code duplication
- **Test organization by architectural layer**:
  - test/unit/ - Unit tests with unit_tests.gpr
  - test/integration/ - Integration tests with integration_tests.gpr
  - test/e2e/ - E2E tests with e2e_tests.gpr
- Professional documentation (SDS, SRS, Test Guide, Quick Start)
- Makefile with comprehensive build/test/coverage targets and color-coded test summaries
- Code coverage support with GNATcoverage RTS
- PlantUML diagram generation tooling
- Example greeter application demonstrating all patterns
- **And_Then_Into**: Cross-type Result monad chaining for transforming Result[T] to Result[U]
- **Map_Error combinator**: Error transformation in `Domain.Error.Result`
- **SPARK readiness assessment**: New Section 10 in Software Design Specification
- **Domain vs Functional Result documentation**: Clarified two Result types in SDS
- **Purpose comments**: Added to 8 Ada package bodies
- **Test fixture headers**: Documented expected violations in test fixtures

#### Release Scripts
- **AI Assistance Section Validation**: Step 0d validates README placement (blocking)
- **Git History AI Marker Scan**: Step 0e scans for AI attribution in commits (warning)
- **Embedded Version Generation**: ada.py embeds version generation logic (no external script)
- **Library Detection**: go.py auto-detects library vs app for version package path

#### Documentation
- **SDS Version Package Section**: Added Cross-Cutting concerns documentation
- Professional documentation (SDS, SRS, Test Guide, Quick Start)

### Changed
- **README.md Standardized**: New documentation format with proper section order
- **AI Assistance & Authorship Section**: Legally required disclosure added to README
- Renamed test directory from `tests/` to `test/` (Ada standard convention)
- Enhanced Makefile test-all target with professional bordered success/failure indicators
- **Format_Greeting moved to Application layer**: Greeting format logic relocated from Domain to Application
- **Command DTO boundary isolation**: `Max_DTO_Name_Length := 256` separate from Domain's 100-character limit
- **Documentation regenerated**: Complete documentation refresh per agent standards
- **Release scripts refactored**: Modular adapter pattern for multi-language support
- **cleanup_temp_files.py enhanced**: Now supports both Ada and Go projects
- **Makefile cleanup**: Removed non-existent examples targets
- **Script Organization**: Reorganized scripts into purpose-driven subdirectories
- **GNATcoverage Runtime**: Automated runtime build from sources

### Removed
- **Application.Model.Unit**: Eliminated unused model package
- **Obsolete documentation guides**: architecture_mapping.md, ports_mapping.md
- **Deprecated release helper scripts** (replaced by adapter pattern)
- Deleted tzif-specific scripts not applicable to hybrid_app_ada

### Fixed
- **Makefile**: Fixed invalid `--validation` Alire flag, now uses `--development`
- **Release script improvements**:
  - Fixed validator false positives for tree-context file references
  - Use `make build-release` instead of `make build` for production builds
  - Use `make test-all` for comprehensive test execution
  - Handle UTF-8 encoding errors in colorized command output
  - Skip pattern templates in file reference checks
  - Check test files in proper subdirectories
- **Code Quality**: Resolved all compiler warnings and style violations (357 automated fixes)
- **Code Safety**: Eliminated unsafe code in Infrastructure.Adapter.Console_Writer
- **Architecture Validation**: Fixed path detection in `arch_guard.py`
- **Build System**: Corrected Makefile FORMAT_DIRS syntax

### Architecture Patterns
- **Static Dependency Injection**: Generic packages with function parameters (compile-time DI)
- **Result Monad**: Railway-oriented error handling (no exceptions across boundaries)
- **Presentation Isolation**: Only Domain layer is shareable across apps
- **Minimal Entry Point**: Main delegates to Bootstrap.CLI.Run (3 lines)
- **Ports & Adapters**: Application defines ports, Infrastructure implements adapters

### Technical Details
- Ada 2022 with aspects (not obsolescent pragmas)
- Bounded strings (no heap allocation in domain)
- Pre/Post contracts on all public operations
- Pure domain logic with zero dependencies
- Functional composition via generics

### Documentation
- README with architecture overview and static dispatch explanation
- 5 UML diagrams documenting architecture
- Software Design Specification
- Software Requirements Specification
- Software Test Guide
- Quick Start Guide
